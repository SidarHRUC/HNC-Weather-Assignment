This is my Java program for the assignment. It uses the London weather data to calculate the average temperature and search for a specific month.

## How to use this code
1. Download the `WeatherApp.java` file from this repository.
2. Open **NetBeans IDE** on your computer.
3. Create a new project or open the file.
4. Click **Run**.
5. The program will ask you to type a month (e.g., "Aug") to see the temperature.
